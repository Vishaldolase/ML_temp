Algorithms for image processing

Object Detection:
Region-based CNNs (R-CNN): Uses region proposals and CNNs for object detection.
Faster R-CNN: Enhances R-CNN with a region proposal network (RPN).
YOLO (You Only Look Once): Real-time object detection with a single pass through the network.
SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): Combines multiple aspect ratio bounding boxes in each grid cell.

Semantic Segmentation:
U-Net: Popular for biomedical image segmentation.
SegNet: Utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture.
DeepLab: Employs dilated convolutions and atrous spatial pyramids.
Mask R-CNN: Extends Faster R-CNN for pixel-level segmentation.

3D pointcloud processing:

PointNet and PointNet++: PointNet is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing point cloud data. It can be used for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object recognition. PointNet++ is an extension that improves its hierarchical feature learning.

Voxel-based CNNs: Voxel grids are 3D grids that can be used to represent point cloud data in a structured way.
